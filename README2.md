Using Psuedocode for this assignment helped a lot!  I was able to map out what the website needed to do step by step which stopped me from getting overwhelmed.  I used the moment() API to set the date and the time and took advantage of youtube videos and stackoverflow when I was unsure of what need to be done.  w3schooles helped a lot as well when it came to figuring out jquery syntax and DOM manipulation.
